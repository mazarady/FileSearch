This project is one that can search for files in a directory (and all of its subdirectories, and their subdirectories, 
and so on) with interesting characteristics and take some kind of action on those files. Both the notion of interesting 
characteristics and taking action will be configurable and can each work in a few different ways, but the core act of 
finding files will always be the same. 

To start out, input a path, for instance:  /User/mazarady/Desktop/Hi
From here your choices include: 

N: (Enter Name of file you would like to search for)
E: (Enter extension you would like to search for)
S: (Enter Number of bytes you would like to search for)


Next there, your choices include: 

P: Prints Path to console
F: Reads First Line of File 
D: Makes Duplicate copy of the File
T: Modifies the timestamp:

Sample Input/Output: 
Enter Path: /Users/mazarady/Desktop/Hi
N: Name, E: Extension or S: Bytes: N caesarCipher.py
P: Prints path to console or F: Reads first line of file or D: Makes duplicate copy of the file or T: Modifies the timestamp:  P
/Users/mazarady/Desktop/Hi/caesarCipher.py
